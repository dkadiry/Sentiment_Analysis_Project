# Sentiment_Analysis_Project
## Content
This repository contains the source code for an LSTM-Ensemble Movie review classifier. The hybrid model was trained on 25000 movie reviews. Tested and Validated using 12500 reviews. The model achieved an accuracy of 86.4%

## Potential Future Development
Implementing Average Pooling on extracted features from LSTM Hidden layer
Increasing the number of neurons in LSTM model

## Project Notebook
We primarily used Google Drive, Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for working on the project. The current project notebook is titled Sentiment_Analysis_Project.ipynb

## Dataset
The dataset is included in the "Dataquest Dataset" excel worksheet file

# Sentiment_Analysis_Project
## Content
This repository contains the source code for an LSTM-Ensemble Movie review classifier. The LSTM is used as a feature extractor for the an ensemble of an SVC, XGBoost and KNN classifier. The final ensemble model uses hard majority voting. The hybrid model was trained on 25000 movie reviews. Tested and Validated using 12500 reviews. The model achieved an accuracy of 86.4%

## Potential Future Development
Implementing Average Pooling on extracted features from LSTM Hidden layer
Increasing the number of neurons in LSTM model

## Project Notebook
We primarily used Google Drive, Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for working on the project. The current project notebook is titled [Sentiment_Analysis_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/dkadiry/Sentiment_Analysis_Project/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis_Project.ipynb)

## Dataset
The dataset is included in the "Dataquest Dataset" excel worksheet file
